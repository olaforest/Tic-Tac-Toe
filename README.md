# Tic-Tac_toe

Instructions
 - To play the game, each player uses the mouse subsequently to click on the desired location of where they want to place their next mark (i.e. 'X's or 'O's).
 - Follow the instructions displayed to know which player's turn it is.

Comments
 - I was not sure what sort of display was wanted/required, therefore I chose to implement a simple GUI.
